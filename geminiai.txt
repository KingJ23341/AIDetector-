- We sincerely apologize for the recent instances of **admin abuse** and the **unfair banning of players** within our game. We understand that these actions have caused frustration, disappointment, and a breach of trust within our community.

We recognize that our administrative powers were misused, leading to a negative experience for those affected. This behavior is unacceptable and goes directly against the principles of fairness and enjoyment we strive to uphold for all players.

We are taking this matter very seriously and are committed to addressing it thoroughly. We are reviewing our internal policies and procedures for administrators, and we will be implementing measures to ensure such incidents do not happen again. Our goal is to create a safe, welcoming, and equitable environment for everyone.

Thank you for your patience and continued support. We are dedicated to regaining your trust and making our game a better place for all.
