Hello there.
How are you doing today?
What's up?
My name is Jack.
It's so nice to meet you today.
Welcome to Roblox.
Hello there, my name is Joshua.
Why are my eyes so fricken cloudy?
Omg, this is so annoying. Ughhhh.
Same here. Write a random sentence.
Or is it because I'm right by my curtians and it's bright out? Also can those affects become permanent?
